# Migrations

## Introduction
Migrations are typically paired with Kasfy's schema builder to build your application's database schema. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.

## Generating Migrations
```bash

    kasfy make:migration users

```

## Migration Structure

```json
{
    "name": "users", //This key represending table name
    "primary": "id", // Auto initializing primary key as id
    "fields": { // Set you want field names and types
        "name": "varchar(255) NOT NULL",
        "email": "varchar(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE",
        "password" : "varchar(255)"
    }
}
```

## Running Migrations
```bash

    kasfy migrate
    
```
Drop tables and re-migrate
```bash

    kasfy migrate:fresh

```

## String data types

**`CHAR(size)`**: A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1

**`VARCHAR(size)`**:   A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535

**`BINARY(size)`**:    Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1

**`VARBINARY(size)`**: Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes.

**`TINYBLOB`**:    For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Max length: 255 bytes

**`TINYTEXT`**:    Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters

**`TEXT(size)`**:  Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes

**`BLOB(size)`**:  For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of data

**`MEDIUMTEXT`**:  Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters

**`MEDIUMBLOB`**:  For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 16,777,215 bytes of data

**`LONGTEXT`**:    Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters

**`LONGBLOB`**:    For BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data


## Numeric data types:

**`BIT(size)`**:   A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. The size parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for size is 1.

**`TINYINT(size)`**:   A very small integer. Signed range is from -128 to 127. Unsigned range is from 0 to 255. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)

**`BOOL`**:    Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true.
BOOLEAN Equal to BOOL

**`SMALLINT(size)`**:  A small integer. Signed range is from -32768 to 32767. Unsigned range is from 0 to 65535. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)

**`MEDIUMINT(size)`**: A medium integer. Signed range is from -8388608 to 8388607. Unsigned range is from 0 to 16777215. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)

**`INT(size)`**:   A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)

**`INTEGER(size)`**:   Equal to INT(size)

**`BIGINT(size)`**:    A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. Unsigned range is from 0 to 18446744073709551615. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)

**`FLOAT(size, d)`**:  A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, and it will be removed in future MySQL versions

**`FLOAT(p)`**:    A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If p is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE()

**`DOUBLE(size, d)`**: A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter
  
**`DECIMAL(size, d)`**:    An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0.

**`DEC(size, d)`**:    Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)

## Date and Time data types:

**`DATE`**:    A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'

**`DATETIME(fsp)`**:   A date and time combination. Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'. Adding DEFAULT and ON UPDATE in the column definition to get automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time

**`TIMESTAMP(fsp)`**:  A timestamp. TIMESTAMP values are stored as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch ('1970-01-01 00:00:00' UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC. Automatic initialization and updating to the current date and time can be specified using DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in the column definition

**`TIME(fsp)`**:   A time. Format: hh:mm:ss. The supported range is from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'

**`YEAR`**:    A year in four-digit format. Values allowed in four-digit format: 1901 to 2155, and 0000.
